<h1>This is the Second Quarter!</h1>
<p align="center">Even if a lot of suspensions and holidays occured during this quarter, this quarter definitely felt like the longest ever! We already had a lot of activities and performance tasks assigned to us. One example is Volleyball. We had Volleyball as our Performance Task in P.E and I had so much fun playing. Even though I was very tall and had “advantage,” I was a scaredy-cat! I didn’t like volleyballs hitting me and I didn’t like the pressure I felt when the ball was coming near me whenever I was playing in court. But with much practice, I excelled in Volleyball. Though I may not be as great as the others, I definitely learned a lot and my skills have excelled a lot during this quarter.</p>

<p align="center">A lot more projects occured during this quarter, including VPOP and MVP. VPOP is when we make our own jingle and add some dance and fun to it! We had to present it in the entire school and make the judges happy so they could give us a high score and maybe land on the top 3! But unfortunately, we didn’t place. But even if we didn’t place, what mattered to us the most during that time is that we finish our VPOP and have lots of fun and show the school what amazing talent we have in singing and in dancing!</p>

<p align="center">During MVP, we had to resource a lot of recyclable materials such as newspapers, paper plates, magazines, plastic spoons, plastic straws, and a lot more! My grandfather loves to read newspapers and collect them and every end of the month, he sells them at a junkshop so I asked permission from my grandfather if I could bring some to school and he agreed! Me and my classmates bonded a lot during this time as we had a chance to talk with each other every time our teachers gave us time to finish the gown. Eventually, all our hard work paid off as our class representative, Asia Masangkay, won first runner up!</p>

<p align="center">And lastly, our Christmas Party! After all our hard work and stress during MVP and VPOP, we finally had time to enjoy the holiday season with each other. Our Christmas Party’s theme Crazy NOT SO Rich Asian and our color scheme was blue. We had lots of fun and a lot of games to play. When it finally came to gift-giving, we gifted our teacher a SEVENTEEN K-POP Album as that was our adviser’s favorite K-POP group. I was also surprised when the person who picked me gave me a book that I wanted for a long time! And get this, he also gave me 1000 pesos! I was so shocked and so happy and I was so grateful.</p>
