<h1>This is the Fourth Quarter!</h1>
<p align="center">This quarter was definitely the shortest and it almost feels like as if it was very, very rushed. A lot of school suspensions also occured due to the extreme heat so a lot of our classes were held online. Even our first day of long tests were held online. A lot of our activities were passed online including the zumba.</p>
<br>
<p>Even though our zumba was passed online, me and my members still had to meet up face-to-face so we could film our zumba. Our zumba was definitely tiring and made my body a bit sore. We used songs like Whoops Kirri to really energize our audience to stand up and dance!</p>

<p align="center">Additionally, we created a magazine for Arts. We had to pick a certain opera character and pose as if we were going to play that role! Here’s mine:</p>

<p align="center">Overally, I had so much fun this school year and I will definitely miss all the memories I’ve made this year. I wouldn’t be here now if it weren’t for my amazing teachers who guided and supported me through everything and my classmates for making this year memorable and fun. Thank you for reading my website!</p>
