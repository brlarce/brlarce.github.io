<h1>This is the Fourth Quarter!</h1>
<p align="center">This quarter was definitely the shortest and it almost feels like as if it was very, very rushed. A lot of school suspensions also occured due to the extreme heat so a lot of our classes were held online. Even our first day of long tests were held online. A lot of our activities were passed online including the zumba.</p>
<br>
<p>Even though our zumba was passed online, me and my members still had to meet up face-to-face so we could film our zumba. Our zumba was definitely tiring and made my body a bit sore. We used songs like Whoops Kirri to really energize our audience and lure to stand up and dance!</p>

<p align="center">Additionally, we created a magazine for Arts. We had to pick a certain opera character and pose as if we were going to play that role! Hereâ€™s mine:</p>

<p align="center">Lastly, we filmed a short musical for our MAPEH Performance Task which tackles a societal issue: Bullying. We incorporated music that would give more meaning to our film but not make it boring to watch at all.</p>

<p align="center">As I conclude this Grade 9 ICT TLE portfolio, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and growth. Through this journey, I have not only gained valuable skills but also developed a deeper understanding of the role of education in our lives and society. Each project, task, and lesson has contributed to my growth, equipping me with the tools and knowledge to navigate the digital world confidently. As I step forward, I carry with me the lessons learned and the experiences gained, ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I am grateful for the guidance of my teachers, the support of my peers, and the opportunity to explore and innovate in the world of ICT. This portfolio stands as a testament to my journey, showcasing my progress and passion for technology. I look forward to continuing this journey, eager to explore new horizons and make meaningful contributions in the ever-evolving field of ICT.</p>
